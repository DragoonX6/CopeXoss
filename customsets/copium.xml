			<text>[Auto]:  When this SIGNI is vanished, look at the top 3 cards of your deck.  You may set 1 of them on 1 of your SIGNI Zones as a Trap. Put the rest on the bottom of your deck in any order.
(Traps are set on SIGNI Zones facedown.  A SIGNI Zone may only have 1 Trap on it at a time.  When a SIGNI on your opponent's field attacks towards a SIGNI Zone with a Trap, if there is no SIGNI on that SIGNI Zone, you may flip the Trap face-up and trigger its [Trap] ability if any.  Then put the flipped card into the trash.)</text>
